## Roadmap

I've updated this repository after it was inactive for several years. The remaining steps for existing charts are:

1. [ ] Style the 404 page
1. [ ] Remove or change dependencies
    - [ ] Remove Angular and Bootstrap but keep same look and feel
1. [ ] Port Stylus files to CSS files using PostCSS
    - Use `npm run print-styl`
1. [ ] Add disclaimer for old charts
1. [ ] Resolve TypeScript cases with `any`
1. [ ] Resolve TypeScript cases with `@ts-ignore`
1. [ ] Set the TypeScript threshold to 95%
