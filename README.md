# Demos

## New Roadmap

This repository after it was inactive for several years. The initial planned improvements are:

1. [x] Port all examples to JavaScript from CoffeeScript
1. [x] Move from Sails.js hosted in Heroku to a static Gatsby site hosted in Github pages
    - [x] Support loading different scripts per demo
    - [ ] Setup 404 page
1. [x] Implement strict rules in ESLint for all the code
1. [ ] Refactor charts into components that can be configured and rendered multiple times on the same page
1. [ ] Upgrade all dependencies to latest version - this will take some time for D3 as several APIs changed
    - All global dependencies should be removed and fetched by npm using the version
1. [ ] Remove or change dependencies
    - Remove: Bower, jQuery
1. [ ] Port styles to CSS with preprocessors (postcss)
1. [ ] Add a CI that checks linting, static types and unit tests
1. [ ] Update the general UI framework (better support for responsive) but maintain the look and feel
1. [ ] Improve performance of some charts
1. [ ] Add disclaimer for old charts
1. [ ] Port all examples to TypeScript with a high type coverage

Some new examples may be added at the same time, especially when more progress is done
